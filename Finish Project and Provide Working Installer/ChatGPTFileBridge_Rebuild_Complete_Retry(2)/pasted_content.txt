Here’s the updated **Manus AI prompt**, now with **clear instructions at the end** to compile and produce a working, installable Windows Service executable:

---

You are a senior C# systems engineer.

Your task is to build **WinBridgeAgent** — a secure Windows Service written in .NET Core 8 that enables controlled access to a local folder through named pipes. This bridge allows local tools (like LLMs or automation agents) to interact with files securely and under strict authorization.

OBJECTIVE:
Create a fully functional, production-ready Windows Service that exposes a file operations interface over named pipes, with:

* Controlled folder access (sandboxed root)
* Token-based authentication with expiration
* Read, write, delete, and list file APIs
* Structured Serilog logging in JSON format
* Attribution, licensing checks, and code fingerprinting

The result should be a self-contained Windows executable that runs as a service and is configurable via appsettings.json.

CODE PROTECTIONS & LICENSE FINGERPRINTING (REQUIRED):

1. Add this comment to all main classes:
   // Part of WinBridgeAgent (c) 2025 Vladislav Manoilov

2. Log this on service startup:
   {
   "Event": "ServiceStart",
   "Origin": "WinBridgeAgent",
   "Author": "Vladislav Manoilov",
   "License": "NonCommercial"
   }

3. Print this warning at service start:
   \[WinBridgeAgent] Non-commercial license. Contact vlad \[at] gmail \[dot] com for commercial terms.

4. Use fingerprinted names like:
   Log.WinBridge.CreateAudit
   SecurityTokenManagerVlad

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:

1. Service Host:

* .NET Windows service using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
* Loads appsettings.json
* Registers all components via DI

2. Named Pipe Server:

* Uses System.IO.Pipes
* Accepts JSON requests and returns JSON responses
* Handles operations like CreateFile, ReadFile, DeleteFile, ListFiles
* Validates token before each request

3. File Operation Manager:

* CreateFile(string relativePath, byte\[] content)
* ReadFile(string relativePath)
* DeleteFile(string relativePath)
* ListFiles(string relativePath)
* Enforces path safety and root containment

4. Token System:

* Generate and validate tokens with expiration (default 60 min)
* Token settings configurable in appsettings.json
* Tokens required for every operation

5. Security Layer:

* Prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., ../)
* Allow only specified file extensions (configured)
* Full operation-level access validation

6. Logging:

* Use Serilog
* Log all operations to JSON files in BridgeLogs/
* Use rotating logs (retention days configurable)

CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE (appsettings.json):

{
"Service": {
"RootFolder": "C:\BridgeRoot",
"MaxFileSize": 104857600,
"AllowedExtensions": \[ "\*" ]
},
"Security": {
"TokenValidityMinutes": 60,
"RequireAuthentication": true
},
"Logging": {
"Directory": "C:\BridgeLogs",
"RetentionDays": 30
}
}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

* Fully working Windows service
* Compiles under .NET Core 8
* Uses proper folder structure: Core, Managers, Security, Infrastructure
* Includes all .csproj and .sln files
* Includes example appsettings.json
* Includes attribution in logs and class headers
* Fully runnable, with install instructions

COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (MUST BE INCLUDED IN OUTPUT):

1. Use `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true` to build a self-contained executable.
2. Output must include:

   * Executable `.exe` file
   * All necessary `.dll` dependencies
   * `appsettings.json` in the output directory
3. Provide a PowerShell script or command instructions to:

   * Register the executable as a Windows service (`sc create` or `New-Service`)
   * Start, stop, and uninstall the service
4. Verify it works on a clean Windows machine without needing .NET installed (self-contained).
5. Output structure must be portable and ready for deployment.

Produce the full system in one pass. No placeholders or stubs. The code must be immediately usable and secure.

Start now.
