# WinBridgeAgent Addons (GUI Control Panel & Installer) TODO

This document outlines the tasks required to develop the WinBridgeAgent Control Panel GUI and the self-extracting installer.

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Design (Current)

- [x] Analyze GUI Control Panel requirements.
- [x] Analyze Installer requirements.
- [x] Define project structure for GUI (WPF .NET 8) and Installer (NSIS).
- [x] Identify dependencies (e.g., service interaction, Windows API calls, System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController, System.IO.Pipes, System.Text.Json for GUI; NSIS scripting for installer).
- [x] Plan GUI layout (tabbed or sidebar). Chosen: Tabbed layout.
- [x] Plan named pipe communication strategy for GUI to interact with the WinBridgeAgent service (GUI will use existing `GetToken` command; other operations like service control and config will use OS APIs and direct file access as per notes at the end of this todo file. A `RevokeToken` command for the service is noted as a potential future enhancement for the service itself if explicit server-side revocation is needed beyond token expiry or the GUI simply ceasing to use a token).
- [x] Create a placeholder `LICENSE.txt` file..

## Phase 2: GUI Control Panel - Project Setup & Core

- [x] Create main project directory: `WinBridgeAgentAddons/WinBridgeAgentControlPanel`..
- [x] Create WPF .NET 8 project: `WinBridgeAgentControlPanel.sln` and `WinBridgeAgentControlPanel.csproj`..
- [x] Design main window layout (e.g., using tabs for Dashboard, Configuration, Tokens, Logs, Service Tools, About).
- [x] Implement basic UI elements for each section..
- [x] Implement named pipe client logic to communicate with the WinBridgeAgent service.
    - [x] Helper class for sending requests and receiving responses.
    - [x] Define DTOs for GUI-Service communication (if different from service's internal DTOs or if new commands are needed).
- [x] Implement logic for reading and writing `appsettings.json` for the WinBridgeAgent service (Service class created, path discovery/setting pending UI integration).
    - [x] Ensure path to `appsettings.json` is configurable or discoverable (e.g., relative to service executable location, which might need to be found or configured in the GUI). (Initial service class supports setting path; discovery logic pending UI/ViewModel).
- [x] Implement Windows Service interaction logic (using `System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController` or P/Invoke for `sc.exe` like functionality). (Core ServiceManager class created for status, start, stop, restart, path discovery; install/uninstall pending UI/ViewModel and will likely use sc.exe/PowerShell).

## Phase 3: GUI Control Panel - Dashboard Implementation

- [x] **Service Status Display**:
    - [x] Implement logic to detect if WinBridgeAgent service is installed. (Implemented via ServiceManager)
    - [x] Implement logic to get service status (Running, Stopped, Paused, etc.). (Implemented via ServiceManager)
    - [x] Display status dynamically. (Implemented in RefreshDashboardAsync)
- [x] **Service Control Buttons**:
    - [x] Implement "Start Service" button functionality. (Implemented in StartServiceButton_Click)
    - [x] Implement "Stop Service" button functionality. (Implemented in StopServiceButton_Click)
    - [x] Implement "Restart Service" button functionality. (Implemented in RestartServiceButton_Click)
    - [x] Ensure buttons are enabled/disabled based on service status. (Implemented in RefreshDashboardAsync)
- [x] **Current Token Display**:
    - [x] Implement logic to request the currently active token from the service (Implemented in RefreshDashboardAsync via _pipeClient.GetTokenAsync).
    - [x] Display the token and its expiry (if available). (Implemented in RefreshDashboardAsync, expiry approximation based on config).
- [x] **Open Logs Folder Button**:
    - [x] Read logs directory from `appsettings.json` (Implemented in RefreshDashboardAsync via _configService).
    - [x] Implement button to open this folder in Windows Explorer. (Implemented in OpenLogsFolderButton_Click)

## Phase 4: GUI Control Panel - Configuration Tab Implementation

- [x] **UI Elements for Configuration**: (All UI placeholders added in MainWindow.xaml)

- [x] **Save and Apply Configuration**: (Implemented in SaveConfigButton_Click with validation)
- [x] **Validate and Reload Config**: (Validation in Save, Reload via LoadConfigButton_Click)

## Phase 5: GUI Control Panel - Tokens Tab Implementation

- [x] **Generate Token Button**: (Implemented in GenerateTokenButton_Click)
- [x] **Display Token + Expiry**: (Implemented in GenerateTokenButton_Click, expiry approximation based on config)
- [x] **Revoke Token Button**: (UI placeholder commented out as service support is TBD, no GUI logic implemented)
- [x] **Copy to Clipboard Button**: (Implemented in shared CopyTokenButton_Click handler)

- [x] Prepare final message to user with deliverables. (Will be done in next step).

## Notes on Service Interaction for GUI:

The GUI will need to interact with the WinBridgeAgent service for:
- Getting status.
- Starting/Stopping/Restarting (these are OS level service controls).
- Getting/Generating tokens (via named pipe `GetToken` command, potentially new `RevokeToken` command).
- Reading/Writing configuration (`appsettings.json`). This could be direct file access if the GUI knows the service path, or via new named pipe commands (`GetConfig`, `SetConfig`). Direct file access is simpler but requires the GUI to know the service install path and have rights. A named pipe command for config would be cleaner. For now, assume direct `appsettings.json` read/write by GUI, path needs to be discoverable.
- Reading logs (direct file access to `BridgeLogs/` directory).

**Decision**: For configuration, the GUI will attempt to read/write the `appsettings.json` file directly. The path to this file will need to be located (e.g., by finding the service executable path from the registry or a configuration setting within the GUI itself). For token operations, it will use the named pipe. For log viewing, it will read files directly from the configured log directory.
