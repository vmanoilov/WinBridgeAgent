## Source Layout

The service implementation lives under `src/WinBridgeAgent`. It is a .NET 8
worker service that exposes a named pipe interface for file operations. A token
manager enforces authentication and all activity is logged via Serilog.

## Building from Source

1. Install the **.NETÂ 8 SDK**.
2. Run the publish command from the `src` directory:

   ```bash
   cd src
   dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o ./publish_output
   ```

   The resulting `publish_output` folder contains `WinBridgeAgent.exe` and
   `appsettings.json`. See `src/INSTALL.txt` for detailed installer and service
   instructions.
